## Email SES Solution 

Third-party email services are often use generic domains like `@gmail.com` that look **unprofessional**. This solution uses **AWS SES with serverless infrastructure**, enabling email delivery from **your own domain** for professional appearance, with an **auto-forwarder** that routes incoming messages to free inboxes like Gmail - keeping your inbox functional without losing messages.

This system is perfect for **low to medium email volumes**, **cost-effective**, **easy to use**, boosts **team/startup credibility**, and **scales** as needed.
